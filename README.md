This is Brian Lipscombe's first Milestone Project at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net).

## User Experience (UX)

* User Stories

    1. First Time Visitor Goals

        As a first time patient visitor, I want to learn more about the company's services and why I should choose them over other facilities. Specifically, how they cater toward patients who are obese and/or claustraphobic.
        I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find information and see images of the magnet and room.
        I want to look for news articles to understand why the company is trusted.
        I also want to locate their social media links to see their followings on social media to determine how well-known they are.

        As a first time physician visitor, I want to learn why I should refer my patients there.
    Specifically, I want to know how trusted the radiologists are, how fast the turnaround rate is from exam to report, how good the quality of images can be, the protocols, and type of contrast injection medium used.

    2. Returning Visitor Goals

        As a returning patient visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the company with any questions or to schedule an appointment, and the address of the facility.

        As a returning physician visitor, I want to easily find information related to why I chose to refer my patients there, in order to quickly show other physicians and physician assistants the benefits of the facility. 

    3. Frequent Visitor Goals

        As a frequent patient user, I want to easily shedule appointments, and check to see if there are any newly added news articles, posts, or blogs.

        As a frequent physician user, I want to quickly contact the facility's front desk to confirm appointments.
        I want to call the radiologists to discuss exams and report findings. I want to contact the MRI technologists to discuss protocols for specific patients.

* Design

    1. Color Scheme

        The three main colors used are blue, white, and green for big Earthly tones.

    2. Typography

        The main font used is Roboto with sans-serif as a fallback. Times font with sans-serif as a fallback was used in the news articles section to try and provide a nostalgic newspaper feel and to add separation. The font embedded in some of the photoshopped images such as the bore-measurements.jpg and services.jpg is Arial.

    3. Imagery

        The largest background image is a still screenshot of an HD video obtained using the developer's personal [Storyblocks](https://www.storyblocks.com/?gcn=SBBrand-Search-Brand-US&gclid=CjwKCAiAiML-BRAAEiwAuWVggo-djJQvd1RW96YYoCAr_nMd_41Y84SLAl6aFla-xWfeehrZNmONlxoCioMQAvD_BwE) account. It is designed to feel open and airy, to reflect the vastness and non-claustraphobic feel of the facility.
        All the other images were either photoshopped from scratch or licensed from Adobe Stock and edited.

* Wireframe

    View the developer's Balsamiq mock-up [here.](https://slack-files.com/T0L30B202-F01DR572PA6-885d54115c)

## Features

* Responsive on all device sizes, although sized in Google Chrome Developer Tools mainly using iPhone X and desktop browser views.
* Interactive elements: Bootstrap carousel, buttons, and form.

## Technologies Used

* [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

* [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

## Frameworks, Libraries, and Programs Used

1. Bootstrap 4.1.3:
Bootstrap was used to assist with the responsiveness and styling of the website.

2. Google Fonts:
Google fonts were used to import the 'Roboto' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

3. Font Awesome:
Font Awesome was used on all pages throughout the website to add icons for aesthetic and UX purposes. The red health heart was obtained [here](https://www.pngaaa.com/detail/622939) and the wheelchair icon from [here,](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wheelchair_symbol.svg) both were added during the image editing process of the services.jpg and not added as code icons.

4. Git:
Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.

5. GitHub:
GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

6. Adobe Photoshop Elements:
Adobe Photoshop Elements was used to create images from scratch or to edit licensed photos from Adobe Stock.

7. Balsamiq:
Balsamiq was used to create the wireframes during the design process.

## Testing

All files and pages were validated by direct input with no syntax errors using:

* [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input)
* [W3C CSS Validation Service]()

## Known Bugs

* On some mobile devices the footer gets pushed upward to overlap other content on the lower portions of the pages. This project was sized in Google Chrome Developer Tools mainly using iPhone X and desktop browser views.

## Deployment

### GitHub

This project was deployed to the developer's respository page:
https://github.com/BrianLipscombe/SkyViewMRI


## Credits

* Code

    Bootstrap4: Bootstrap Library used throughout the project mainly to make the site responsive using the Bootstrap Grid System.

    Code for buttons from [Bootstrap's custom button styles](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/).

    Carousel from [Bootstrap's slideshow components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/carousel/).

    Matt Rudge: Code used as a starting template from Code Institute's Senior Product Developer Matt Rudge's [Whiskey Drop Service example](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/BootstrappingYourNextBigIdea-BS4/tree/master/04-BeyondBootstrap/03-cleaning_up_our_content) from the "Bootstrapping Your Next Big Idea With Bootstrap 4" course, of the User Centric Frontend Development module.  

    Code for social icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

    All other code was written by the developer.

## Acknowledgements

* Guidance and Moral Support

    Caleb Mbakwe: My mentor Caleb for helping me with my layout design, steering me toward Balsamiq for my wireframe mock-up, and for plenty of direct positive reinforcement.

    Code Institute on Slack: While stumped a couple times, digging deep into the Slack Community for anykind of help, I found answers while reading threads written between Abi Harrison and Rory.
